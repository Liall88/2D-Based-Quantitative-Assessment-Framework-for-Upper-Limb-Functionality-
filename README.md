2D- Motor Function Analysis Neural Network (working Title)


The increase in the world elderly population paired with a global nursing shortage has motivated
the research and development of quantitative assessment for rehabilitation. In spite of existing
assessment technology, there is yet to be a method of quantitative assessment of upper limb
functionality that has been universally adopted, with most clinicians using traditional and
subjective means. In order to mitigate this lack of adoption, this thesis presents a 2D Based
Quantitative Assessment Framework for Upper Limb Functionality aimed at providing effective
quantitative assessment while exploiting the ease of use of 2D data collection. The framework is
based on clinical standards, extracting functionality related features from 2D video of subjects
completing movement exercises in accordance with an experimental set up. Those features are
used to train support vector regression models to learn quantitative assessment functions which
generate an assessment score given a set of features.
